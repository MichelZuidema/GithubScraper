# GithubScraper

GithubScraper gets the source code from the url that the user will put in. It will scrap the Title, Description, Code Language and the Repository URL and will put it into a CSV file.

# How Do I Use This?

Run the code with the following line:
`python main.py`
There is a chance that this line will not work, it depends on what kind of python version you have installed and which what program you try to run it in.

When you run the script it will ask you the following: "Github URL:". Enter the Github URL in there. Example: https://github.com/MichelZuidema. The script will do the rest.
